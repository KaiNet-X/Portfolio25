<h1>Work experience</h1>

<p>
    I have been working with John Deere's part time student program as a "part time student IT" from December 2021 to the present day. 
    I have worked on an agile team, and have collaborated with project managers, UX designers, and across teams
    to deliver value to the company. I have seen several projects to completion, and am actively working on others.
    Prior to Deere, I interned at AgriSync where I developed an external web diagnostic tool.
    Below is a list of projects I have worked on, from newest to oldest.
